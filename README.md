### Plotting mathematical functions

This mini-project can draw multiple mathematical functions in a canvas and zoom, drag, 
as well as downloading an image of the visible canvas.

This class uses [JavaScript Expression Evaluator](https://github.com/silentmatt/expr-eval) to convert the input string to a calculable expression.
Also, it uses [Konva.js](https://konvajs.github.io/) to draw on the canvas.
